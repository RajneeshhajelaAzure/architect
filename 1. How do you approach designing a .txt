1. How do you approach designing a scalable and secure architecture for a high-traffic application?
Focus: Scalability, security, performance, and availability.
Why they ask: This question evaluates your ability to design solutions that can handle growth and adhere to security best practices. Be prepared to discuss horizontal scaling, cloud-native solutions, and securing APIs.

2. Can you explain how you have handled system integration in a large-scale enterprise project?
Focus: Integration patterns, APIs, and middleware.
Why they ask: Integration across legacy systems and modern platforms is a common challenge. Provide examples where youâ€™ve used integration techniques such as message queues, API gateways, or microservices.

3. Describe a time when you had to refactor or migrate a monolithic application to a microservices architecture.
Focus: Migration strategy, challenges, and outcomes.
Why they ask: They want to assess your experience with modernizing legacy systems and adopting microservices, including challenges like data consistency, orchestration, and service discovery.

4. How do you ensure compliance and governance in your architectural designs?
Focus: Governance, compliance, standards, and regulations.
Why they ask: They want to see your understanding of regulatory frameworks (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and how you enforce compliance while designing solutions.

5. How do you handle non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, latency, availability) in your architecture?
Focus: Balancing NFRs with functional requirements.
Why they ask: Architects must ensure systems meet critical performance and uptime expectations. Use examples to explain how you achieved high availability using solutions like caching, load balancing, or failover strategies.

6. Describe a challenging situation where you had conflicting stakeholder requirements. How did you resolve it?
Focus: Communication, collaboration, and problem-solving.
Why they ask: Solution Architects often mediate between business and technical teams. Showcase your ability to balance priorities and negotiate solutions that align with business goals.

7. What is your approach to managing technical debt in an enterprise system?
Focus: Long-term maintainability and continuous improvement.
Why they ask: They want to see how you prioritize improvements, reduce legacy dependencies, and align technical decisions with the business roadmap.

8. Can you walk us through your process for creating a roadmap for a new IT solution?
Focus: Strategic planning, milestones, and deliverables.
Why they ask: This question evaluates your ability to balance immediate project needs with long-term business objectives, as well as your planning and prioritization skills.

9. How do you approach ensuring data consistency and reliability in a distributed architecture?
Focus: Eventual consistency, transactional integrity, and patterns like SAGA or CQRS.
Why they ask: Distributed systems often deal with data synchronization challenges. They want to understand your experience with patterns to handle these challenges effectively.

10. Can you explain a major failure or challenge you faced in a project and how you resolved it?
Focus: Problem-solving, adaptability, and learning.
Why they ask: They want to understand how you deal with unexpected challenges, mitigate risks, and ensure project success. Provide an example that highlights your proactive approach and collaboration.
